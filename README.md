**to create a 2D floor plan projection of a cube's vertices**
<br>
-should include pygame library
<br>
  for the window size and caption for the visualization
  <br>
-a list of 3D points (using numpy matrices) representing the vertices of the cube<br>
-defines a 2D projection matrix to remove the Z-axis information, effectively projecting the cube onto the XY plane<br>
**-logc can be similarly be used for converting 3d images into floor plans<br>
  if we create mesh or skeleton of the 3d image it then can be manupilated into 2d matrices.**
