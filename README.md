**to create a 2D floor plan projection of a cube's vertices**
-should include pygame library
  for the window size and caption for the visualization
-a list of 3D points (using numpy matrices) representing the vertices of the cube
-defines a 2D projection matrix to remove the Z-axis information, effectively projecting the cube onto the XY plane
-logc can be similarly be used for converting 3d images into floor plans
  if we create mesh or skeleton of the 3d image it then can be manupilated into 2d matrices.
